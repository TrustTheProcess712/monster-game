# Welcome to my monster-game!

This is just a little Free Code Camp project that I completed to refamiliarise myself with Javascript fundamentals that I recently learned on a boot camp. 

It was kind of fun to complete and my little boy enjoyed having a go at defeating the Dragon.

Clone down the repo and run the code in youre browser to have a turn at slaying the beast yourself if you like!
