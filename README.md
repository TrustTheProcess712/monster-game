# Welcome to my monster-game!

This is just a little Free Code Camp project that I completed to re-familiarise myself with the Javascript fundamentals that I recently learned on a boot camp. 

It was kind of fun to complete, you can visit a store to buy new weapons to battle the beast in the cave and theres even a secret game to find.

My little boy enjoyed having a go at defeating the Dragon, why dont you clone down the repo and run the code in youre browser to have a turn at slaying the beast yourself!

Have Fun!
